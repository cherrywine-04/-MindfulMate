The project focuses on building a conversational agent dedicated to offering vital mental health support. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, the chatbot engages users in meaningful conversations to understand their unique needs. It provides a wide array of resources, including coping strategies, relaxation techniques, and links to relevant mental health materials. With features such as sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and data analytics, the chatbot ensures that the support offered is tailored to each individual, enhancing its effectiveness in addressing mental health concerns. This project represents a groundbreaking step towards transforming mental health care into an accessible, stigma-free, and efficient system for those in need.
